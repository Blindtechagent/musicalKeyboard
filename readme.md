# Musical Keyboard Addon -- Version 1.0

The Musical Keyboard addon turns your keyboard into a simple musical
instrument. When the musical mode is on, pressing certain keys will play
musical notes using NVDA\'s built-in sound system. This can be a fun and
accessible way to explore pitch, practice note positions, or just enjoy
some casual music-making.

You can turn the musical keyboard on or off anytime using the shortcut:
**NVDA + Shift + L**.
